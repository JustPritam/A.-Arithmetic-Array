To make the arithmetic mean be equal to exactly 1 the sum needs to be equal to the number of elements in the array.

Let's consider 3 cases for this problem:

1) The sum of the array equals n: Here the answer is 0 since the arithmetic mean of the array is initially 1.

2) The sum of the array is smaller than n: The answer is always 1 since we can add a single integer k such that sum+k=n+1 is satisfied and more specifically k=n−sum+1.

3) The sum of the array is greater than n: If we add any number apart from 0 will add to the sum more or equal than to the number of elements. 
   The number of 0's to add can be found by a loop of adding 0's until the number of elements is equal to the sum or by the simple formula of sum−n.
